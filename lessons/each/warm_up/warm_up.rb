# Warm Up

# Take the next 2-3 minutes to look at the example below.
# In your notebook or in this file, write down your answers to the following
# questions.

# 1. What is the 'Collection'?
# collection is a data set that stores multiple pieces of data
# 2. What do you notice about the code below?
# repetitive 
# 3. What issues could potentially crop up?
# if array changes you might not be able to access other elements
# 4. Is there an alternative you could propose?

students = ["Megan", "Bob", "Mike"]
students.each do |student|
   puts student
end

# Go ahead and play in your terminal to see what the outputs are.
# After you take a guess, uncomment each `puts` one at a time.
# See if you were correct.
